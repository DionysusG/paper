you can clean your TODO log! (you cannot do it when you add it because it's not something you'd like to do... yea... but you can if you want, I'll consider)

just grab things with @blabla  and they will be sorted! (sounds not so useful...)
and new todos with the @balbal will fall their with times stamps

todo ihavedown (or just done)

a config page (absolutely)
